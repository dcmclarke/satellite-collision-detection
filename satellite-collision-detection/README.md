# SATELLITE COLLISION DETECTION SYSTEM

## Done So Far

### Completed:
- ✅ Satellite entity with orbital data storage
- ✅ CollisionPrediction entity for tracking close approaches
- ✅ Alert entity for notification management
- ✅ REST API endpoints for all entities
- ✅ PostgreSQL database integration

### Learning Progress:
- Understood Spring Boot layered architecture
- Learned JPA for database operations
- Figured out @Autowired for dependency injection
- Got comfortable with REST controllers

### Next Steps:
- NASA API integration
- Collision detection algorithm implementation
- Email alert system

### Challenges Faced:
- Initially confused about @Entity vs @Service
- Had to debug PostgreSQL connection issues
- Learning curve with Maven dependencies

## Running the Project

1. Start PostgreSQL: `docker run...`
2. Run Spring Boot application
3. Test at `http://localhost:8080/api/satellites`
